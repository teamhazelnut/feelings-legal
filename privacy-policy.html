  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to <strong>Feelings</strong>, a mobile application created by <strong>Team Hazelnut</strong>.
    Feelings is designed to help couples communicate better, reflect together,
    and intentionally grow their relationship through shared activities,
    journals, conversations, and emotional check-ins.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

  <p><strong>a. Account Information</strong><br>
    Name, email address, profile image (Cloudinary), gender, love language preferences,
    and authentication data (Google / Firebase).
  </p>

  <p><strong>b. Relationship and Activity Data</strong><br>
    Chat messages (text), <strong>voice messages and audio recordings</strong>,
    shared journals, private journals, secret notes, memory images,
    bucket list items, mood entries, questions, relationship insights,
    milestones, date plans, calendar events, and other in-app interactions.
  </p>

  <p><strong>c. Location Data</strong><br>
    Approximate location may be used only to calculate distance between connected partners.
    Location data is not continuously tracked, stored, or shared.
  </p>

  <p><strong>d. Device & Diagnostic Information</strong><br>
    Device type, operating system version, crash logs, and performance diagnostics
    collected via Firebase Crashlytics to improve app stability.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use collected information to enable core app functionality
    (such as chat, journals, voice messaging, reminders, and alerts),
    personalize the user experience,
    maintain security,
    improve performance,
    and provide user support when requested.
  </p>

  <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or rent your personal data.
    Your information is shared only:
    with your connected partner,
    with trusted service providers (Firebase, Cloudinary, Google Drive),
    or when legally required.
  </p>

  <h2>5. End-to-End Encryption</h2>
  <p>
    Feelings uses <strong>end-to-end encryption (E2EE)</strong> to protect sensitive
    relationship data between connected partners.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following data is encrypted so that only you and your partner can access it:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Chat messages (text)</li>
    <li>Voice messages and audio recordings</li>
    <li>Shared journals and private journals</li>
    <li>Secret notes</li>
    <li>Encrypted references to images stored via Google Drive</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For images stored in Google Drive, only encrypted references are stored and shared
    within the app. The underlying media remains accessible only through
    user-authorized Google Drive access.
  </p>
  <p>
    Encryption keys are generated and managed on user devices.
    We do not have access to encrypted content.
  </p>
  <p>
    During feature upgrades, previously unencrypted content may be securely migrated
    to encrypted storage using a background (lazy) migration process.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Storage & Security</h2>
  <p>
    Encrypted data is stored using secure infrastructure provided by Firebase
    and Cloudinary. Media files such as images and audio recordings are stored
    only to enable delivery between connected partners.
    Google Drive access is granted solely with explicit user consent
    and limited to selected uploads.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    You may delete individual content or your entire account from within the app.
    Account deletion permanently removes associated data from our systems.
    Due to encryption, some data may not be recoverable once deleted.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may also request account or data deletion by contacting
    <a href="mailto:reach.feelings@gmail.com">reach.feelings@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Feelings is intended for users aged 13 and above.
    Accounts identified as belonging to users under this age are removed immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated as features evolve.
    Any changes will be reflected within the app and on this page.
